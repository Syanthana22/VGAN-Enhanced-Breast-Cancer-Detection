# VGAN-Enhanced-Breast-Cancer-Detection
# Abstract Of the Project

Breast cancers are the major cause of death in women worldwide. Any development for prediction and diagnosis of cancer disease is capital important for a healthy life. Consequently, high accuracy in cancer prediction is important to update the treatment aspect and the survivability standard of patients. Now-a- days, a new developed technique is used to classify the breast cancer. The new developed technique is deep learning. Deep learning is used to overcome the drawbacks of machine learning. A deep learning technique that is mostly used in data science is Generative Adversial Networks. 
A basic Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model utilizing ResNet architecture is then constructed and trained to perform minority selection, balancing the dataset by generating synthetic non-tumorous images. The augmented dataset is subsequently fed into Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for further refinement. The entire model, encompassing both GAN and VAE components, is trained comprehensively. Through fine-tuning, the model's ability to detect tumors in random images is evaluated, aiming to improve the accuracy and reliability of breast cancer diagnosis. 


# Problem Definition

The problem we aim to address revolves around the inherent challenges associated with unbalanced and unlabelled medical image datasets in the context of tumor detection. Healthcare professionals and 
researchersencounter difficulties in accurately identifying tumors due to the skewed distribution of classes and the lack of labelled data. Traditional machine learning approaches struggle to effectively handle such datasets, leading to biased models and suboptimal performance. Moreover, the scarcity of labelled data further exacerbates the problem, hindering the development of robust tumor detection systems. As a result,there is a pressing need for novel methodologies that can effectively handle unbalanced datasets, leverage unlabelled data, and improve the accuracy of tumor detection in medical imaging. 


# Limitations of the Project

Our tumor detection project includes challenges in accessing high-quality medical imaging datasets, ensuring realism in GAN-generated images, and optimizing VAEs for meaningful latent space representation. The model's performance may vary in real clinical settings due to differences in imaging protocols and patient populations. Interpretability of the deep learning model's decisions and the need for substantial computational resources are additional concerns. Moreover, ethical considerations regarding patient privacy and regulatory compliance pose significant hurdles. Addressing these limitations necessitates robust validation on diverse datasets, interpretability techniques for model transparency, and adherence to ethical guidelines for responsible deployment in healthcare settings.
